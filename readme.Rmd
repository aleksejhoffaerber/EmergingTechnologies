## R Markdown

This project had the aim to apply different textual analytics techniques and algorithms in order to identify a) emerging industries and b) emerging technologies used in the aforementioned industries. The approach can be simplified as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
