Goals and Approach
------------------

This project had the aim to apply different textual analytics techniques
and algorithms in order to identify a) emerging industries and b)
emerging technologies used in the aforementioned industries. The
approach can be simplified as follows:

1.  Preprocessing using regexpr

2.  Benchmarking different preprocessing assumptions

3.  Test and training set creation

4.  Corpus creation and boundary testing

5.  LDA training

6.  Identifying emerging topics by emergence analysis

7.  Verification of LDA approach with test/train KWIC analysis

8.  Using bigrams to identify specific complicated industries

Identification of Emerging Industries
-------------------------------------

LDA training with 75 topics and their assignment to the individual
companies by gamma, led to 7 emerging topics:
